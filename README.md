# pos-app-for-orders

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This app is a very simple POS (point-of-sale) application that supports three use cases: creating orders, adding items to an order, and completing or exiting an order. It uses [Serialized](https://serialized.io/) to keep track of events.

## Getting started

To start, clone this repository locally onto your machine or download it as a .ZIP file.

Once you have the repository on your machine, following the steps to get started:

## Initial configuration

- Set up your `.env` files - you will need a `.env` file in the `api` directory (to be used by the backend to authenticate into the Serialized API). You will need a [Serialized](https://serialized.io/) account and within that, a project created in your account.
- Your `.env` file will look like this:

```
SERIALIZED_ACCESS_KEY=
SERIALIZED_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

To find the `SERIALIZED_ACCESS_KEY` and `SERIALIZED_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values, go to Settings > API Keys in your Serialized dashboard for the project you created and set the environment variables to the corresponding values.

## Install dependencies

Once your `.env` is set up, install dependencies. You'll need to do the following:

- In the `api` directory, run `npm install` (installs general back-end dependencies)
- In the `client` directory, run `npm install` (installs React project dependencies)

## Run application

To run your aplication, open a new window or tab in the Terminal so that you have two tabs or windows open.
In one tab, run `npm start` in the `api` folder. (The back-end will run on `localhost:9000`)
In another tab, run `npm start` in the `client` folder.

Once `localhost:3000` launches the front-end, youâ€™ll see the following screen:

## View aggregates and data:

To confirm an order was created, go to your [Serialized](https://serialized.io/) Dashboard for your project you created and go to the Data Explorer page. You'll see a list of orders that have been created.

To confirm items have been added to an order or that your order has been completed, go to your Serialized Dashboard > Data explorer > Aggregates > order (under Aggregate type column) > Aggregates > click the Aggregate ID of the top (and most recent) entry.

To see details on events within an Aggregatem you can click on Event IDs within this view.
